You may not know this, or you may not remember: we all have a **toolbox**. One of those red, metallic ones that open by the middle and have different levels of trays: ðŸ§°.

Every thing we learn, everything someone writes in a book or a blog post, every strategy, tactic, pattern, principle, guideline... Every single one of those things is a tool that goes into that red, metallic toolbox ðŸ§°.

When you face a new assignment, you should open the toolbox ðŸ§°, and move the tools, fiddling with your fingers, looking for the proper ones.

Many jobs are similar, so you may use most of the same tools.

And also each job is unique, so you may have to shuffle your tooling a bit.

And, lest ye forget, the same job can be done in different ways while achieving the same results.

Because technology keeps improving, sometimes some tools appear that can do the same job, but faster, clearer, smaller, etc. They may or may not entirely replace an existing tool. They don't necessarily need to become the new standard. Although sometimes, they do.

Unfortunately this approach is not binary:

- Use this or don't use it.
- Clean or not clean.
- Functional or not functional.
- Java is the best or it is the worst.

And our society has become polarized. Everything has to be dealt on 0s and 1s.

Newspapers, TV news, YouTube videos, Instagram stories... Politics in general. It's all polarized.

Clickbait is just another word for 'polarized statement'. It drives engagement, people feel like they have to defend or attack.

If you don't engage with polarization, people won't like you. They can't put you in a box so they know if they should attack you or defend you.

Because not being polarized requires thinking, and people seems to be tired of thinking.

At the end, it all drips down to your job.

Most of the developers I know just want to be told what to do and how to do it, with very clear instructions, so they they can do their 3 nested loops and 2 ifs and go home at 5pm.

And using the Toolbox ðŸ§°... requires constant thinking.
